To run q10.py ensure python3 is installed on the system, along with
the numpy and matplotlib packages from pip. If you cannot, run the
following commands in terminal:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Provided all those steps succeeded you can run `python q10.py` in the
terminal to view the graphs. Once you're done with the program you
should clean up the virtual environment by running

```
deactivate
rm -rf venv
```

Equivalently, if you have Jupyter notebook installed along with numpy
and matplotlib you can view and run the whole assignment with the
command `jupyter notebook`, and selecting the `graphs.ipynb` file.
